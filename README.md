# NYC-Airbnb-Visualization

## Objective
This project visualizes the Airbnb house-letting scenario in New York City to assist prospective hosts in making informed decisions. It explores how factors such as location, property size, and reviews impact listing prices and popularity, through the fictioonal case of Julie, who wishes to list her property on Airbnb for the first time. 

## Dataset
The dataset comprises over 41,000 Airbnb listings in New York City, including details on host information, location, room type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price, and reviews. Listings with missing price data were excluded from this analysis.

## Visualizations
This project includes a range of interactive visualizations, including the geographic distribution of listings across neighborhoods, the number of listings and average prices by region, and financial insights on the break-even period for property improvements. It also examines the impact of review counts on pricing, helping prospective hosts understand various aspects of the market.
